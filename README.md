## FDOT District 5 Counties
Florida's District 5 is a region in Central Florida that includes the following 9 counties:
1. Brevard
2. Flagler
3. Lake
4. Marion
5. Orange
6. Osceola
7. Seminole
8. Sumter
9. Volusia

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
1. Loaded population projections from `Age Projections - Florida (1).xlsx`
2. Calculated 65+ Aggregate by summing 65-79 and 80+ age groups
3. Aggregated 12 FDOT D5 counties into single region
4. Created dataset with Florida and FDOT D5 Aggregate for years 2025-2050

### Phase 2: Regression Setup
1. Transformed data to long format (12 observations: 2 regions × 6 time points)
2. Created centered year variable: `Year_Centered = Year - 2025`
3. Created binary indicator: `Region_D5` (1 = FDOT D5, 0 = Florida)

### Phase 3: Statistical Regression
**Model Formula:**
```
Population ~ Year_Centered * Region_D5
```

**Full equation:**
```
Population = β₀ + β₁(Year_Centered) + β₂(Region_D5) + β₃(Year_Centered × Region_D5) + ε
```

**The interaction term (β₃) tests if growth rates differ between regions.**

### Phase 4: Hypothesis Test
- **H₀**: Growth rates are equal (β₃ = 0)
- **H₁**: Growth rates differ (β₃ ≠ 0)
- **α**: 0.05
- **Result**: Reject H₀ (p = 0.001132 < 0.05)

## Regression Results

### Model Performance
- **R²**: 0.9969 (99.69% of variance explained)
- **Adjusted R²**: 0.9958
- **F-statistic**: 861.86 (p < 0.0001)

### Coefficients
| Variable | Coefficient | Interpretation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Intercept | 5,588,895 | Baseline population for Florida in 2025 |
| Year_Centered | 78,970 | Annual increase for Florida (per year) |
| Region_D5 | -4,266,025 | D5 baseline difference from Florida in 2025 |
| **Year_Centered:Region_D5** | **-57,893** | **Difference in annual growth rates** |

### Key Insight
The negative interaction coefficient (-57,893) indicates that while D5 has a smaller baseline population, the *percentage* growth rate is higher, as confirmed by the growth percentages.

- **Time Period**: 2025-2050 (5-year intervals)
- **Age Groups**: 65-79, 80+, and aggregated 65+

## Statistical Interpretation

### What the p-value means
A p-value of 0.001132 means:
- There is only a 0.11% chance that the observed difference in growth rates occurred by random chance
- We can be 99.89% confident that the growth rates truly differ
- This is highly statistically significant (well below the 0.05 threshold)

### Practical Significance
FDOT District 5 is experiencing:
- **4.91 percentage points higher growth** in 65+ population compared to Florida overall
- This translates to approximately **554,172 additional seniors** by 2050
- The 80+ age group shows the most dramatic growth in both regions

## Implications
The significantly higher growth rate in FDOT D5 suggests:
1. Increased demand for senior services and healthcare facilities
2. Need for age-appropriate transportation infrastructure
3. Greater focus on accessibility in district planning
4. Economic opportunities in senior-focused industries
